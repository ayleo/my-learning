```javascript
alert(3 + 
1
+ 2);
```


The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus `"+"`, then it is an "incomplete expression", so the semicolon is not required. 

*And in this case that works as intended*. 

See the cases below for a list of scenarios where "incomplete expressions" can be used or not.
