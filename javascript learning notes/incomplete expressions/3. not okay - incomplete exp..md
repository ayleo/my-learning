Below there will be a list of "incomplete expressions" which will cause syntax error and a list which you can get to work still.


Some examples which will **_LEAD_** to syntax errors:

1. Unfinished arithmetic operation:
```javascript
let result = 5 +
```
2. Incomplete function call:
```javascript
console.log(
```
3. Unfinished array declaration:
```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana',
```
4. Incomplete object literal:
```javascript
let person = {
  name: 'John',
  age:
```
5. Unfinished if statement:
```javascript
if (x > 10
```
6. Incomplete ternary operator:
```javascript
let status = isLoggedIn ?
```
7. Unfinished template literal:
```javascript
let greeting = `Hello, ${
```
8. Incomplete arrow function:
```javascript
const multiply = (a, b) =>
```
9. Unfinished destructuring assignment:
```javascript
const { name, age,
```
10. Incomplete switch statement:

  case 'Monday':
    console.log('Start of the week');
