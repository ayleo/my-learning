Below there will be a list of 8 scenarios where the "incomplete expressions" will be *okay* to use, but most likely **they may turn into an error later** on so it is best to not practice these scenarios.

These examples demonstrate that context is crucial in JavaScript. What might appear incomplete at first glance can sometimes be valid code, depending on how it's used or continued. However, it's generally best practice to write clear, complete expressions to avoid confusion and potential errors.

1. Multi-line statements: JavaScript allows splitting long statements across multiple lines. For example:
```javascript
let sum = 5 +
          10 +
          15;
console.log(sum); // 30
```

2. Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE): An incomplete-looking expression can be part of an IIFE:
```javascript
(function() {
    console.log("This works!");
})(); // This works!
```

3. Tagged template literals: What looks like an incomplete template literal can be a tagged template:
```javascript
function myTag(strings, ...values) {
    return strings[0] + values[0].toUpperCase();
}

let name = "alice";
console.log(myTag`Hello, ${name}!`); // Hello, ALICE!
```

4. Comma operator in return statements: What appears to be an incomplete object can use the comma operator:
```javascript
function foo() {
    return (
        console.log("This logs first"),
        { name: "John" }
    );
}
console.log(foo()); // logs "This logs first" then {name: "John"}
```

5. Arrow functions with object literals: What looks like an incomplete object is actually a valid arrow function:
```javascript
const getUser = () => ({
    name: "John",
    age: 30
});
console.log(getUser()); // {name: "John", age: 30}
```

6. Conditional (ternary) operator continuation: What seems like an incomplete ternary can continue on the next line:
```javascript
let status = isLoggedIn
    ? "Welcome back!"
    : "Please log in";
```

7. Destructuring with rest parameters: An apparently incomplete destructuring can use rest syntax:
```javascript
const { name, age, ...rest } = { name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York", country: "USA" };
console.log(rest); // {city: "New York", country: "USA"}
```

8. Generator functions: What looks like an incomplete function can be a generator:
```javascript
function* numberGenerator() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
}
```
