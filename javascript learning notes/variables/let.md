let can be re-assigned.

### Examples of usage:

1. Multiple variables in one line
```js
let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';
```

2. Multiline variant (the normal way)
```js
let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello';
```

3. Multiple variables in a multiline style (it contains 3 spaces)
```js
let user = 'John',
   age = 25,
   message = 'Hello';
```

4. "comma-first" style
```js
let user = 'John'
  , age = 25
  , message = "Hello";
```

All styles work just fine, but for readability purposes, stick with the second option.
